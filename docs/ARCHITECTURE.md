# Architecture

anima is a Rust CLI tool that plants growth-capable seeds into projects. Its
architecture is the relationship between its documents, the seed it produces,
and the CLI that delivers it.

## Document Layers

```
  Philosophy (anima-specific)
       |
       | interprets, does not override
       |
  Spec + Guide (discipline-level)
```

The **Harness Specification** and **Harness Guide** describe harness engineering
as a discipline — the general theory. They adopt a control perspective. The
**Philosophy** reinterprets the same axioms through a cultivation lens. This is
a one-way dependency: the Philosophy builds on the Spec/Guide but the Spec/Guide
are independent of anima.

## The Seed

```
  Philosophy §4 (theory of what a seed should be)
       |
       | realized by
       |
  seed/ (concrete files anima init produces)
```

The `seed/` directory contains the exact files that `anima init` plants into a
user's project. The only parameterized value is `{project-name}` in
`seed/AGENTS.md`. The seed implements Philosophy §4 and addresses the memory
paradox identified in §6.2 through its cultivation protocol.

### Seed Generations

Seeds are versioned by generation — a simple integer incremented when a
meaningful capability is added. The marker `<!-- anima:seed:N -->` at the end
of `seed/AGENTS.md` records the generation. Seeds without a marker are
generation 1 (all seeds planted before this mechanism existed).

`anima check` detects the planted generation and, if it's behind the current
generation, outputs specific upgrade suggestions. The agent reads these
suggestions and applies them — no forced overwrite, because the seed files are
living documents that the project has already modified. This is cultivation,
not control: observe, suggest, let the agent act.

## The CLI

```
  seed/ (source of truth for seed content)
       |
       | embedded via include_str!
       |
  src/main.rs (CLI binary)
```

The CLI embeds seed files at compile time using `include_str!`. This means
the binary is self-contained — no external files needed at runtime.

Two commands exist:

- **`anima init`**: Writes seed files and replaces `{project-name}` with the
  project name (inferred from directory or provided via `--name`). Refuses to
  overwrite an existing `AGENTS.md`.

- **`anima check`**: Reads the project's harness files and reports their
  cultivation state — which areas have grown and which remain dormant. This is
  the spirit's first "sense": it observes four signals (state phase,
  architecture documentation, decision records, conventions) and produces a
  compact summary designed for agent consumption at session start.

## Engineering Infrastructure

Unit tests in `src/main.rs` (`#[cfg(test)] mod tests`) cover the parsing
functions that power `anima check`: phase extraction, seed generation detection,
convention counting, and seed embed integrity. These are the spirit's sensory
organs — they must be reliable.

GitHub Actions provides two workflows:

- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Runs `cargo test` and `cargo build` on
  all three platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) for every push to `main` and every
  pull request.

- **Release** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): Triggered by version tags
  (`v*`). Builds release binaries for four targets (x86_64 Linux, x86_64 macOS,
  aarch64 macOS, x86_64 Windows), packages them, and publishes to GitHub
  Releases with auto-generated release notes.

## Translations

Every document in `docs/` has a Chinese translation (`*.zh-CN.md`) alongside.
English is written first; Chinese is translated to match (信达雅 standard).
Translations are maintained in parallel — a change to the English version
requires a corresponding change to the Chinese version in the same commit.

## What Does Not Exist Yet

- **Spirit infrastructure**: No `.anima/` directory, no persistent service, no
  ecosystem signal processing. These belong to the awakening phase (§6.4).
